Wireless Equivalent Privacy, or WEP as it's commonly referred to, has been around since
1999 and is an older security standard that was used to secure wireless networks. In 2003,
WEP was replaced by WPA and later by WPA2. Due to having more secure protocols available,
WEP encryption is rarely used. As a matter of fact, it is highly recommended that you never
use WEP encryption to secure your network! There are many known ways to exploit WEP
encryption and we will explore one of those ways in this recipe.
In this recipe, we will use the AirCrack suite to crack a WEP key. The AirCrack suite (or AirCrack
NG as it's commonly referred to) is a WEP and WPA key cracking program that captures
network packets, analyzes them, and uses this data to crack the WEP key.
